## How to reserve a device and run selenium tests
When devices are connected and are visible in Mobile Manager, you can try to reserve a device and run selenium tests against created Appium endpoint.

In the folder `AppiumTests` you can find simple examples of Python selenium tests. You can create your own test based on these or changing the `desired_caps` inside one tests to your own device and run it.
