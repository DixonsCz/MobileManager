# Contributions welcome
Mobile manager project is meant to help others to manage their phones connected to their computers. As we'd like to help others, we are open to other helping us as well. We surely cannot manage to advance Mobile Manager forward as we'd wish to. 

If you are interested in the project or you wish to help, read below our basic contribution guidelines and get started!
## Become a contributor
Mobile manager uses the Fork and Pull development model. Follow these steps if you want to merge your changes to MobileManager:

* Within your fork of **Mobile Manager**, create a branch for your contribution. Use a meaningful name.
* Create your contribution, meeting all contribution quality standards described below in **Code quality requirements**
* [Create a Pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) against the master branch of the MobileManager repository.
* Add two reviewers to your pull request (a maintainer will do that for you if you're new). Work with your reviewers to address any comments and obtain a minimum of 2 approvals. To update your pull request amend existing commits whenever applicable and then push the new changes to your pull request branch.
* Once the pull request is approved, one of the maintainers will merge it.
